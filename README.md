# Selenium Java Testing Framework
## Description:

This repository provides a robust and well-structured Selenium Java testing framework designed to simplify and enhance your web application automation efforts. It promotes maintainability, scalability, and reusability of your test scripts.

## Features:

- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Encapsulates UI elements and interactions for clean test logic.
- **TestNG Integration**: Leverages TestNG's powerful features for test execution, reporting, and assertions.
- **Driver Management**: Simplifies browser driver setup using WebDriverManager (or your preferred approach).
- **Configuration Management**: Easily manage test environment configurations (e.g., URLs, credentials) using properties files or environment variables.
- **Test Data Management**: Separates test data from test scripts for better organization and maintainability (e.g., CSV, JSON, or database).
- **Logging**: Integrates with a logging library (e.g., Log4j, SLF4J) for detailed test execution logs.
- **Reporting**: Offers clean and informative test reports (e.g., TestNG reports, Allure reports).
- **Modular Design**: Promotes code reusability through well-defined classes and packages.
